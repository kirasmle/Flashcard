                <p>Hi everyone! My name is Kira and I am a sophomore at UMD
                    studying Computer Science. Outside of school, I love to 
                    workout, shop, and EAT. Fun Fact: I am currently learning 
                    German!
                </p>
            <h2 class="experience">Experience</h2>
            <p>This past summer, I had an internship at a company called Impact Research.
                Here I mined and cleaned data from over 20 Maryland cities speed camera 
                datasets (2015-2021), ensuring data accuracy. I also utilized Excel
                and learned SAS to process, visualize, and analyze large datasets,
                identifying trends in the impact of speed cameras on reducing vehicle speeds.
                Ultimately I presented data-driven recommendations to the Maryland
                Highway Safety Office, supporting the effectiveness of speed cameras 
                in reducing fatal and injury-related car crashes.
